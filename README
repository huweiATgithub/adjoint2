Modify the code in:
  https://bitbucket.org/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint/src/2019.1.0/docker/fenics/stable

Change logs:
add package file, suggested in compilation of ipopt
upgrade pip, otherwise it will show warning each time calling it.
remove unnecessary fenics_prefix as we install ipopt in /usr/local
configure installation of ipopt and pyipopt to use hsl

To use, git clone and docker build ., remember to put source code of hsl in it.
to check:
1. in source code of ipopt, do make test
2. in pyipopt_dir/examples, change .py file to python3 version, run it.
3. git clone --branch=2019.1.0 --depth=1 https://bitbucket.org/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint.git, in tests and examples, run those .py files.
